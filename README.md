# Project Title

This application is a simple private messaging board that uses Flask to authenticate and store user information and messages.
Login credentials are securely stored in database using a Bcrypt hash.
The appplication also creates a unique token upon login to prevent user spoofing session data to delete messages that do not belong to them.

This Flask application repo skeleton was auto generated by a handy bash script.
